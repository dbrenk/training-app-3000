# üß† training-app-3000

A Flask-based web interface for browsing image/audio training sets stored in a filesystem.
It dynamically loads training sets, displays corresponding `.jpg` and `.m4a` files,
and provides simple navigation and diagnostics.

## üöÄ Features

- Browse through training image/audio pairs
- Auto-indexes training sets on startup
- Serves media content with safe path joining
- Environment-configurable root directory and logging
- Diagnostic `/about` page with environment and platform info

---

## üìÅ Directory Structure

The app expects a directory like:

```
training_sets/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ set1/
  ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ img001.jpg
  ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ img001.m4a
  ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ set2/
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

Each subdirectory under `TRAINING_SET_ROOT_DIR` is treated as a training set.

## üîß Configuration

Set environment variables before running:

| Variable               | Description                                                | Default           |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `TRAINING_SET_ROOT_DIR`| Path to training sets directory                            | `training_sets`   |
| `LOG_LEVEL`            | Log verbosity (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, etc.)                      | `INFO`            |

---

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-project>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the App

```bash
export TRAINING_SET_ROOT_DIR=path/to/training_sets
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
python app.py
```

Runs on: [http://0.0.0.0:5000](http://0.0.0.0:5000)

## üåê Routes

### `/` or `/viewer`
- Displays image/audio pairs
- Query params:
  - `set`: training set name
  - `index`: image index (default = 0)

### `/training_sets/<set_name>/<filename>`
- Serves media files (image or audio) securely

### `/about`
- Shows app metadata, environment vars, and diagnostics

---

## üìÑ Templates Required

Ensure the following are present in `templates/`:

- `viewer.html`
- `about.html`

---

## üõ† Logging

- Logging is set up via `log_config.setup_logging()`
- Supports log rotation
- Middleware: `ProxyFix` (for reverse proxy support)

---

## üß† Core Logic

- Caches training sets and image names on startup
- Randomizes image order for variety
- Uses safe file joining to avoid directory traversal
- Handles errors gracefully with logging

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Only `.jpg` images and `.m4a` audio files are supported.
- Audio is optional but must share the same base name as the image.
- Make sure training sets are readable and properly structured.
